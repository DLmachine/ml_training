A repository for a variety of Data Science "skill-builders".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview
The DSBC team has spent years developing tools and training materials for Applied Math and Data Science.
In this project you will find the following tools.
* ["Notes on ..."](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/math_notes) these are cheet sheets on various topics of Machine Learning, e.g. algebra, calculus, probability theory, etc.
* ["10 steps to Data Science"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/10-steps-to-DS) is a series of notebooks to teach you the most common tools used in Data Science.
* ["10 steps to Machine Learning"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/10-steps-to-ML) is a series of notebooks to teach you some advanced tools used in Machine Learning. 
* ["Python in 2 days"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Python-in-2-days) is a series of notebooks to get you started in Juypter notebooks and Python.
* ["Machine Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Machine-Learning-in-1-day) is a series of notebooks focused on a basic toolbox for Machine Learning.
* ["Deep Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Deep-Learning-in-1-day)  is a series of notebooks focused on GANs and Transformers.
* ["Examples"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Examples)  is a series of notebooks that most folks will find useful for a variety of reaal-life applications of Data Science.

## New to Python and Jupyter Notebooks?
Have you heard about Jupyter Notebooks, but dont know how to get started? Here is a quick tutorial.

* First, navigate to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to download the software and install it on your computer (PC or Mac).

* Now, download this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training) to your computer.

* Un-zip the files to the following directory (for PC users): "C:\Users\(your user name)\Notebooks\"
![Alt Text](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/directory.png | width=100)
* Open Anaconda, and click on the launch icon for Jupyter 
![Alt Text](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/anaconda_ui.png | width=100)
* We recommend that you start with the "01_Notebooks.ipynb", but for this demo we click on the "02_Python.ipynb".
![Alt Text](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/jupyter_ui.png | width=100)
* Once the notebook has opened on your browser, you can read through it and run each cell (to learn how to do this, go back to "01_Notebooks.ipynb")
